                Solar energy: what you need to know
            </h2>
            <p>
                Solar power is usable energy generated from the sun in the form of electric or thermal energy. Solar
                energy is captured in a variety of ways, the most common of which is with photovoltaic solar panels that
                convert the sun’s rays into usable electricity. Aside from using photovoltaics to generate electricity,
                solar energy is commonly used in thermal applications to heat indoor spaces or fluids. Residential and
                commercial property owners can install solar hot water systems and design their buildings with passive
                solar heating in mind to fully take advantage of the sun's energy with solar technology.

                Interested in benefiting from solar power? Solar panels are installed at three main scales: residential,
                commercial, and utility. Residential-scale solar is typically installed on rooftops of homes or in open
                land (ground-mounted) and is generally between 5 and 20 kilowatts (kW), depending on the size of a
                property. Commercial solar energy projects are generally installed at a greater scale than residential
                solar. Though individual installations can vary greatly in size, commercial-scale solar serves a
                consistent purpose: to provide on-site solar power to businesses and non-profits. Finally, utility-scale
                solar projects are typically large, several megawatt (MW) installations that provide solar energy to a
                large number of utility customers.

                For some solar shoppers who may not be able to install solar on their property, community solar is a
                viable solar option that more directly connects utility-scale solar energy projects to residential
                consumers. As such, community solar farms are typically built in a central location as opposed to on any
                single customer’s property. Residential consumers can subscribe to a community solar project to receive
                many of the benefits of solar power without installing solar panels on their property.

                <h2>
                    The cost of solar energy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concurrent with an increase in solar panel efficiency, the cost of solar energy has fallen
                    substantially. In the last decade alone, the cost of a solar panel installation fell over 60
                    percent, and many industry experts predict that prices will continue to fall in the years to come:
                    Additionally, depending upon where you live, several rebates or incentives for solar power may
                    contribute towards lowering the cost of solar energy even further. Nationwide, the federal
                    Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is one of the primary incentives available to anyone interested in solar
                    energy, as it allows you to deduct 30 percent of the cost of installing a solar system from your
                    federal taxes. Many states and utilities offer further incentives (such as net metering) in addition
                    to the federal ITC, dropping the cost of solar power even further.
